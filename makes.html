  Neutron stars are formed when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses. The very central region of the star ,the core ,collapses, crushing together every proton and electron into a neutron. If the core of the collapsing star is between about 1 and 3 solar masses, these newly-created neutrons can stop the collapse, leaving behind a neutron star. (Stars with higher masses will continue to collapse into stellar-mass black holes.)

<figcaption>This animation shows Swift observations the X-ray halo of magnetar SGR J1550-5418 <br>during flares in January 2009. At times, the object produced hundreds of bursts in as <br>little as 20 minutes, and the most intense explosions emitted more total energy than the <br> sun does in 20 years. High-energy instruments on many spacecraft, including NASA's <br> Swift and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, detected hundreds of gamma-ray and X-ray<br>  blasts.
